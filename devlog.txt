Dev log for Kate and Jordan

Pico-8 gaming in Lua.

Day 1: 5/12/16
- Watched demos
- Watched example games (called cartridges)
- Explored Pico8 (found really weird things..)
- Cartridge = Game
- Learned a little Spanish (un poco)
- Learned how to move up, down, left, and right
- Created a character (sprite)
- Sprite = character
- Made some background sprites, haven't used them yet

Day 2: 5/16/16
- Read over example code
- Understood some of what the terms meant
- Tried to make a make all types of characters method and a make player method (we had previously just initialized player outside of any methods)
- Figured out that didn't work and tried to fix it
(at night): Read tutorials of Lua code and tried to find gravity examples

Day 3: 5/17/16
- Searched on reddit and twitter pages for Pico8 to find tutorials (was not successful)
- Made more sprites
- Read through example code
- Attempted to animate sprite, made it move but then got it stuck
- Future Plans: understand the example code and make it animated and invoke gravity somehow..

Day 4: 5/19/16
- Made enemy sprites
- Made different sprites for the animation
- Figured out how to make sprite animated
- Implemented animation
- Prevented sprite from moving off the screen

Day 5: 5/21/16
- Altered animation (aka made it walk a bit differently) by changing sprites
- Made background and implemented in game

Day 6: 5/23/16
- Attempted to implement gravity
- Searched and found example code for jumping on lexaloffle
- Example code didn't work in our code so back to square one
